	<h3>What is an Open-Source project ?</h3>	
	<p>Everything is available for free to anyone as long as they don't use it in closed source products. The "source code" is available for modification or enhancement by anyone under permissive licenses. Users with access to the tools that can read and manipulate these source files can update and improve the code that underlies the physical device. They can add features or fix bugs in the software. They can even modify the physical design of the object itself and, if they wish, proceed to share such modifications.</em></p>
