	<h1>CyberPony : HorseRiding 4.0</h1>
	<h2>Open Source training equipement for riders and horses</h2>
	<h3>What is an Open-Source project ?</h3>	
	<p>Everything is available for free to anyone as long as they don't use it in closed source products. The "source code" is available for modification or enhancement by anyone under permissive licenses. Users with access to the tools that can read and manipulate these source files can update and improve the code that underlies the physical device. They can add features or fix bugs in the software. They can even modify the physical design of the object itself and, if they wish, proceed to share such modifications.</em></p>
	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>This project aims to empower every riders to do specific training and have both real-time feedback to adapt and improve during a training session and also gain insight about his progression over the long term. This project will provide both hardware and software as a platform for user to gather and analyze their training data. With only the integrated hardware of a phone, il is possible to track metrics like session time, speed, distance travelled. External devices are also needed to have a better tracking, with reins tension, leg pressure, accurate movement tracking for gait and hand detection, heart rate monitoring, breathing tracking.</em> 
Data itself is not relevant, you want to be able to extract valuable information. It can be done directly by the rider, if he has the required knowledge, it can be done with alongside the trainer to help him focus the training sessions for the rider. Or it can be analyzed automatically and be reflected to the user as a set of metrics and advices.</p>
	<h3>Technical base of the project</h3>
	<p>It is now possible to have powerfull tools to create harware products with cheap and easy to use software. This project will use the Arduino platform alongside ESP32 microcontrollers for the sensors. The Arduino platform is easy to get into with a lot of documentation and tutorials. The ESP32 is a 4â‚¬ microcontroller with wifi and Bluetooth capabilities, in a small formfactor. It is widly used and again a lot of documentation online allows for anybody to quickly learn how to use it. It is similar to a standard arduino board. All the hardware parts will use off off the shelf parts widely available, and make use of 3D printed parts. With the democratisation of fablab (Assosciation that gather tools like 3D printer, laser cutter, Wood working,... and make it available to the members for a small subscribing fee) it is possible for anybody to access and learn to use a 3D printer.</em>i</p>
	<h3>State of the industry</h3>
	<p>The Equestrian world did not change it's training methods for a very long time. Most sports already had a shift in their training methods through the use of technology to track and optimize training at various levels. New startups and products are slowly becoming available for riders but the development is slow and targeted to a small part of the equestrian world. All the data gathered is behind a subscription model, and is heavily dependent on the proprietary algorithms without empowering the end user. The best way to really improve on the technology is to be able to reach a large audience and build upon the feedback and needs of different part of the community. This is why the Open-Source approch seems to be the best way going forward.</p>
	<h3>State of the Project</h3>
	<p>The project is in its infancy and is focused on delivering a simple android application with a rein tension sensor.</em>
This proof of concept aims to show the potential of such a project and gather a team of people motivated to help the project going further.</p>
