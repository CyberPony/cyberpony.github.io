	<h2>Real Time tension measure and feedback</h2>
	<p>This project consists of two modules that are bit between the reins and the bit. It logs the tension that is applied by the rider. An app on your phone logs the data and some data processing can be applied to gather some insight about the force and regularity of the contact. The devices can be linked to LEDs visible by the rider for real time feedback. Some thresghold value for the raw force or the regularity can be set to let know the rider when is is outside the comfort zone of the horse. Symmetry of force in between reins can also be measured during exercise for symmetry purpose. The device might also be linked to the coach for him to know in real time the direct action that the rider has on the horse and correct him. </p>
