	<h1>The CyberPony Project</h1>
	<h2>The origin Story</h2>
	<p>The Horseriding sport did not change their training practices for ages. The technology was never developped to improve training of both riders and horses, as it is the case is almost any other sport. 
	Over the last few years a handfull of companies and startup are trying to bridge this gap but the knowledge and investment is lacking and most of the projects results in expensive marketing stunts that provide few or no help over the long run. Nonetheless the need is present to help lower the barrier of entry by reducung the training time to reach a high level, and make it appealing to the new generations. </em>
	By launching this Open Source project i hope to leverage the talent from this awesome community to be able to create meaningfull products that directly answer a need and being able te make is financially accessible to anybody.</p>

	<p>I am an experienced rider that grew up with horses. I'm 22 years old, i'm French and i love both riding and engineering. 
	During my engineering studies i took a break from horseriding, which allowed me to take a step back from what was hapenning in the industry. 
	I'm comming back to horse riding, and i want to be able to help the industry develop the training equipment to allow riders to improve quickly and being able to have targeting training on various skillset</p>
